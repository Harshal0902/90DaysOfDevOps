# 90DaysOfDevOps

This repository is used to document my journey on getting a better foundational knowledge of DevOps. I will be starting this journey on the 4th April 2022 but the idea is that we take 90 days which just so happens to be April 4th to July 4th.

The goal is to take 90 days, 1 hour a day, to tackle over 13 areas of DevOps to a foundational knowledge.
